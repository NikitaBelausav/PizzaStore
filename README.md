# Pizza Store

This project was created by a team of two people I particularly worked on

# Back-End

-Set up the classes in an OOP mentality, meaning there is an abstract pizza class which is extended by the subtypes of pizza. Namely pepperoni, deluxe, and hawaiian. This allows for inheritence, overriding, and polymorphism. This also helps not rewriting code and is more time-efficient. There is also a PizzaMaker class that is a factory method.

# Front-End

- MVC, each controller maps to a specific view. Like pizzaCustomizationController maps to PizzaCustomization view. 

# Java-Doc

-Includes a JavaDoc with full API documentation.
