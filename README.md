# Pizza Store

This project was created by a team of two people I particularly worked on

# Back-End

-Set up the classes in an OOP mentality, meaning there is an abstract pizza class which is extended by the subtypes of pizza. Namely pepperoni, deluxe, and hawaiian. This allows for inheritence, overriding, and polymorphism. This also helps not rewriting code and is more time-efficient. There is also a PizzaMaker class that is a factory method.

-I mostly worked on all classes relating to creating a customer order, and store orders. I also did all of the controllers. My partner was unavailable for most of the Android project, but it turned out okay because I just believe in getting the work done even if I have to work a bit longer.

# Front-End

- MVC, each controller maps to a specific view. Like pizzaCustomizationController maps to PizzaCustomization view. Built either using scenebuilder or android. 

# Java-Doc

-Includes a JavaDoc with full API documentation.
